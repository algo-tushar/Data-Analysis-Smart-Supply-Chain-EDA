# Data-Analysis-Smart-Supply-Chain-EDA

## Description
Welcome to the **Data-Analysis-Smart-Supply-Chain-EDA** repository! This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a smart supply chain, leveraging data-driven insights to optimize and enhance supply chain management. The repository contains scripts, notebooks, and documentation to facilitate in-depth analysis and visualization of supply chain data.

## Objectives
- Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis on supply chain datasets.
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies within the data.
- Generate actionable insights to improve supply chain efficiency and decision-making.
- Visualize data using various charts and graphs for better understanding and communication of findings.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Methods to clean and prepare raw supply chain data for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation of key statistical metrics to summarize the data.
- **Data Visualization**: A variety of plots and charts (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) to visualize data distributions and relationships.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examination of relationships between different supply chain variables.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of outliers and anomalies in the supply chain data.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analysis of temporal patterns and trends in supply chain activities.
